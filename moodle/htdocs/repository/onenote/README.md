## Microsoft OneNote Repository Plugin

This plugin allows the user to browse their OneNote Online content, such as notebooks, sections, and pages using the Moodle file picker UI. It also allows them to download the content of their OneNote page. It uses the Microsoft OneNote API Local plugin to do some of these things.
